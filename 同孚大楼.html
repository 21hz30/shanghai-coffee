										<p>Yates Apartments, originally the China Bank West District Branch and later renamed Wujiang Building, sits at the intersection of Nanjing West Road and Shimen 1st Road, diagonally across from the Denis Apartments.</p>
										<p>Built in 1935 by the Bank of China, it took its original name from Tongfu Road (now Shimen 1st Road) where it stood. Designed by Lu Qianshou and Wu Jingqi, and constructed by Dachang Construction Company, the building was completed in 1936. Initially serving as the Bank of China’s West District Branch, its ground floor today houses the ICBC Jing’an Shimen 1st Road Sub-branch. In 1994, the Tongfu Building was included in Shanghai’s second batch of Excellent Historical Buildings.</p>
										<p>The Tongfu Building is a semi-circular nine-story apartment block, 34.45 meters tall, with a floor area of 2,887 square meters and an elevator. Built in the Modernist style with a reinforced concrete structure, its deep brown facing bricks and façade emphasize strong horizontal lines. Flanked on three sides by roads—Nanjing West Road, Shimen 1st Road, and Wujiang Road—the building sits on a corner plot and adopts a point-layout design, maximizing floor area despite the cramped site. Upon completion, the ground floor and basement were used by the Bank of China, while floors two through nine were rental apartments—one two-bedroom, one three-bedroom, and one four-bedroom per floor. At the time, its compact units drew criticism for being cramped. Today, however, this adaptive, site-specific form has made the century-old building an unusually eye-catching landmark.</p>

										<p>From the blooming Gucci Garden to Dior Café at Qiantan, Tiffany’s afternoon tea to the massive Louis Vuitton flagship, the path finally leads to the IWC Big Pilot Bar.</p>
										<p>In recent years, luxury brands have been diversifying aggressively into dining, with coffee and desserts emerging as the hottest arena. More and more brands are exploring how to fuse their signature identity with dining culture, giving customers a dining experience like no other.</p>
										<p>Coffee, as one of the most accessible touchpoints between the fast-moving consumer market and modern lifestyles, offers the quickest way to gauge contemporary tastes, break cultural barriers, and blend seamlessly into local ways of living.</p>
										<p>For luxury brands, venturing into coffee is not only a shortcut to building deep, multidimensional connections with high-end consumers and boosting sales—it’s also a marketing tool for promoting the high-end lifestyle, a way to export a brand’s rich and diverse cultural narrative.</p>
										<p>By weaving coffee into the brand experience, reshaping communication content, and creating social-media-friendly destinations, these cafés generate powerful storytelling value. They help brands reach new audiences, draw in more foot traffic, break through cultural “bubbles,” and—most importantly—win over younger consumers in a fresh, approachable way.</p>
