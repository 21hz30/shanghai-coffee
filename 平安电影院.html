											<p>On the southwest corner of Nanjing West Road and Shaanxi Road stands a historic building that has carried Shanghai’s memory for nearly a century.</p>
											<p>In 1925, the Sassoon Company commissioned architect László Hudec to design the Peace Building—a seven-story Art Deco structure clad in cream-colored tiles with vertical lines like a ship sailing into the wind. From the rooftop terraces, one could overlook the grand Shanghai Racecourse. It was once a prestigious residence for Shanghai’s elite, with the ground-floor Kaisiling Café perfuming the air for thirty years. Writer Eileen Chang even used it as inspiration for the “Peace Mansion” in her novella Lust, Caution.</p>
											<p>In 1951, the neighboring lot—formerly the mansion of Jewish tycoon Soong Fook—was converted into the Peace Theatre, Shanghai’s first widescreen cinema, which drew huge crowds. In 1972, its distinctive wave-shaped awning was added, becoming an icon of the era. Together, the commercial–residential Peace Building and the cultural–entertainment Peace Theatre became sister landmarks of the neighborhood.</p>
											<p>By the 1990s, the cinema had declined and was eventually demolished (in 2012, its site became the Vacheron Constantin House). The Peace Building itself survived thanks to a 1993 conservation project, preserving Hudec’s curved corner façade and dark-brown window frames.</p>

											<p>Not far away, Foule Coffee—marked by its signature coffee balloon—has landed opposite Prada Rong Zhai on the Shaanxi North Road stretch of Nanjing West Road. This once-traditional shopping street has welcomed a new emblem of Shanghai coffee culture, making every city walk more flavorful.</p>
											<p>The owner, a Shanghai-born “uncle,” insists on using a uniquely Chinese technique: dùn—a slow, double-boiling method for preparing coffee concentrate (there’s no direct equivalent in English cooking terms). The result is smooth, mild, pure, and balanced—“subtle yet not bland”—echoing the gentle, nourishing quality of Chinese tea. It’s easy to accept, needs no specialized equipment, and can be made at home. The concentrate stays stable whether chilled, reheated, or taken to-go, making it suitable for frequent, large servings without losing quality.</p>
											<p>Chinese-style coffee even has its own English name now: Cinesso (沁漺), filling the gap in the world’s coffee landscape with a Chinese contribution. Popular menu items include Yogurt Coffee, Rice Fragrance Coffee, and Alley Milk Cappuccino—all brimming with rich, localized charm.</p>
