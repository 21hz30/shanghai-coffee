									<p>On Huaihai Middle Road, veiled beneath the shadows of plane trees, stands a distinctive white building with a gently blunted corner. Quietly guarding its post for nearly ninety years, this is the iconic Huaihai Building, known affectionately as the “Golden Blunt Corner of Huaihai Road.”</p>
									<p>Originally named Empire Mansions, the building was funded by Zhejiang Industrial Bank and completed in 1934. It is one of the finest examples of modernist architecture in Shanghai’s early 20th-century landscape. The signature V-shaped obtuse corner design not only fits perfectly with the triangular junction of Huaihai and Changshu Roads but has also become a visual anchor of the streetscape.</p>
									<p>Its Art Deco exterior is finished in pristine white paint, adorned with sleek vertical lines that lend a sense of height and elegance. The original blueprints labeled the structure as “Empire Apartments”, suggesting its initial role as upscale residential housing.</p>
									<p>Step inside and you’re transported straight into the 1930s: terrazzo mosaic floors inlaid with brass strips, double-flight staircases with preserved copper railings, and vintage elevators in perfect working order. Even back then, the building boasted hot and cold running water—an extravagant amenity for its time.</p>
									<p>Writer Eileen Chang once captured this lifestyle in her essay “Anecdotes of Apartment Life”, and the Huaihai Building may well have been one of her unspoken inspirations.</p>
									<p>In 1999, it was listed as part of Shanghai’s third group of protected historic buildings. A new phase of restoration began in 2020, focusing on architectural authenticity: all 3,974 steel-framed windows were custom-rebuilt to match the originals, now fitted with double glazing; the street-facing storefronts were set back 50 centimeters to restore the original sawtooth footprint.</p>
									<p>Today, ground-floor shops bustle with activity, while the upper floors remain residential—preserving the 1930s vision of mixed-use urban life. More than just a relic of the former French Concession, the building has witnessed the daily rhythms of several generations of Shanghainese. From 1934 to 2024, the Huaihai Building has remained like a poised lao ke le (old-school gentleman)—graceful, dignified, and unmistakably Shanghai in character. It is a timeless landmark in the city’s cultural memory.</p>
            </span>
            <span id="z5">
									<p>Tucked snugly into the building’s iconic corner is Qiao Coffee, a café with a unique pedigree: it’s backed by the century-old state-owned brand Qiaojiashan, famous for traditional Shanghainese pastries. But it’s not just branding that sets Qiao apart. As Li Fangming, the fourth-generation heir of the Qiao family, puts it:</p>
									<p>“We’re not just selling coffee—we’re teaching coffee to speak Shanghainese.”</p>
									<p>This statement is a bold declaration of intent: a heritage brand’s pledge to bridge past and future, fusing time-honored tradition with the tastes of Gen Z. Here, coffee seeps deep into the glutinous layers of the classic ‘Dingsheng Cake’, a poetic collision of East and West—where an imported beverage finally submits to the comforting rhythms of the Shanghainese palate.</p>
									<p>At its heart, Qiao Coffee is a local reimagining of Western coffee culture, framed through the lens of centuries-old Chinese pastry aesthetics. In this café, a cup of coffee might be accompanied by a soft chewy Tiaotou Cakes,or richly savory pork Zongzi,golden flaky crab shell pastries,or glossy bite-sized Qingtuan rice dumplings. Through these pairings, Western ritual meets Chinese flavor, harmonizing in a uniquely Shanghai dialect of taste.</p>
