											<p>At No. 1262 Yan’an West Road, a striking Spanish-style complex continues to write its century-spanning legend. Originally built in 1924 as the Columbia Country Club, it has since been reborn as “The Columbia Circle” (上生新所)—a creative landmark and cultural hub for Shanghai’s artistic youth.</p>
											<p>Strolling through the compound, the outdoor swimming pool, remarkably well preserved, captures the eye. Built in 1925 as part of the U.S. Navy Club, the pool is lined with blue mosaic tiles, and its tranquil waters reflect the white colonnades around it—evoking a frozen moment of Mediterranean sunlight in Shanghai. Once the social heart of Shanghai’s American expatriates, the pool hosted swimming sailors and glamorous poolside dances. Fascinatingly, the original changing rooms and diving platform remain intact—though now repurposed into a fashion runway and beer garden.</p>
											<p>The main clubhouse, designed by famed Hungarian architect László Hudec, stands alongside the Sun Ke Villa—the former residence of Sun Yat-sen’s son—together forming one of Shanghai’s rare examples of Spanish Revival architecture. With red-tiled roofs, arched windows and doors, and wrought-iron balconies, every detail speaks to the opulence of the 1920s.</p>
											<p>In 2020, Japan’s Tsutaya Bookstore opened its first China flagship here, bringing a breathtaking fusion of historic architecture and literary modernity. The bookstore lovingly preserves original features like the fireplace, Corinthian columns, and mosaic flooring, inviting readers to lose themselves in books surrounded by heritage.</p>
											<p>Spanning 32,000 square meters, the site hides many layers of history: in 1951, it became the Shanghai Institute of Biological Products, contributing to China’s early vaccine research. In 2016, real estate developer Vanke led a sensitive renovation, breathing new life into the old structures—the former boiler room became an art space, the laboratories transformed into creative studios, and even the old smokestack is now a photogenic landmark.</p>
											<p>On weekends, the area bustles with poolside markets, contemporary art exhibitions in historic buildings, and an effortless fusion of old and new. From elite expat social club to vaccine lab to today’s cultural destination, the Columbia Country Club’s century-long transformation is a living metaphor for Shanghai’s urban evolution. As the setting sun gilds the Spanish arcades, and laughter rises around the pool, it’s easy to imagine the echoes of 1920s jazz dancing through the air—proof that this city’s charm never fades.</p>

											<p>Among the many gems inside Columbia Circle is Shardaa, a coffee shop rooted in Tibetan culture. Founded in 2021, Shardaa originated from the Himalayas as a rising brand dedicated to merging Tibetan lifestyle wisdom with modern design. Through coffee, it shares and celebrates Tibetan culture.</p>
											<p>The café’s interior bursts with bold colors and rich ethnic textures, immersing guests in an atmosphere of authentic Tibetan aesthetics. Beyond serving coffee, Shardaa also displays and sells Tibetan carpets, textiles, and household crafts, adding depth and story to the space.</p>
											<p>The drinks menu features innovative takes on Tibetan beverages—including barley wine-flavored specialty coffee and Tibetan milk tea infusions. Even the cups and utensils are infused with cultural identity, using Tibetan script and motifs to express the uniqueness of the region.</p>
											<p>In Tibetan, “Shardaa” means “Cheers,” symbolizing joy, connection, celebration, and blessing. More than just a café, Shardaa is a cultural showcase, a platform bringing Tibetan culture beyond the plateau, fostering exchange and artistic exploration in a vibrant, contemporary setting.</p>
