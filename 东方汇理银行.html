									<p>The Credit Industriel et Commercial (CIC) Bank Building—now the China Everbright Bank’s Bund Branch—is located at No. 29 The Bund. Built in 1914, it was an important financial institution during the French colonial period.</p>
									<p>This classicist architectural gem features an ornate façade, with interiors adorned by marble columns and intricate reliefs. After World War II, the bank withdrew, and the building was used by various organizations. Today, it serves as an office for financial institutions, standing as a microcosm of the Bund’s rich financial history.</p>

									<p>The popular TV drama Blossoms has brought renewed attention to the old Donghai area making it the trending place for dating. As one of Shanghai’s oldest coffee shops with a century-long history, Donghai Café experienced was closed down for renovation before being restored and reopened. Its overall style was however well-preserved as vintage and nostalgic, located on Dianchi Road.</p>
									<p>Donghai Café was once the fashionable hotspot where “Lao Yasuo” (old uncles) longed for in their youth. The iced coffee there carries a classic, old-school flavor, and the traditional butter cake offers the firm, creamy texture reminiscent of childhood malt cream treats. Alongside the coffee, the café serves Western-style pastries like the iconic “Hadou” and “Napoleon”—quirky names that a hundred years ago were exclusive staples on the menus of Shanghai’s stylish elite.</p>
									<p>Nestled near the century-old Bund architectural cluster, Donghai Café stands as a living emblem of Shanghai—a tangible yet invisible history that writes a new chapter in the city’s ongoing embrace and inheritance of coffee, a culture brought from overseas.</p>
