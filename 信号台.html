									<p>Standing at the intersection of East Zhongshan First Road and East Yanan Road on the Bund, the Gutzlaff Signal Tower is a 50-meter structure tower built in 1907. It was once the busiest maritime signal pole in Shanghai, witnessing over a century of changes in shipping along the Huangpu River.</p>
									<p>Designed by Spanish innovator and industrialist Modesto Marti de Sola, the tower features a unique architectural style including a blend of reinforced brick construction, Baroque domes, and classical columns. It is one of only two remaining buildings worldwide with this distinctive style.</p>
									<p>Before the radio communication was widely used, the tower’s weathervane, signal balls, and the noon “time ball” played a critical role, providing essential meteorological, tidal, and timekeeping information to all ships passing. It was then considered a wisest early 20th-century maritime assistant.</p>
									<p>In 1993, this 450-ton structure underwent an astonishing “relocation,” moving the entire structure 20 meters eastward, a landmarking achievement in Shanghai’s architectural preservation history.</p>
									<p>Though no longer in use today, this historic building, listed in the China Industrial Heritage Protection Register, still silently speaks its own narrative of Shanghai’s transformation from a shipping port to an international trading center, making it one of the Bund’s most distinctive historical landmarks.</p>
            </span>
            <span id="z5">
									<p>For a period of time, the Signal Tower also housed a café on the second floor, while the ground floor served as a historical exhibit. Unfortunately, this café inside the protected heritage building was closed down.</p>
									<p>Just a five-minute walk away, at the crossroad on Fuzhou Road, another cafe called Dugout is highly recommended. What makes Dugout special is its charitable mission: all the baristas are either deaf or hearing-impaired. Customers place orders using a writing pad or simple sign language and even enjoy discounts for doing so.</p>
									<p>The cafe’s interior is designed in a cave-like style, making use of the rough walls and arched structures typical of the Bund’s historic architecture, evoking the atmosphere of an old air-raid shelter.</p>
									<p>When you order a coffee here, you’re not just buying a drink—you’re participating in an exchange built on courage, understanding, and equality. Customers mimic sign language gestures as hearing-impaired baristas skillfully craft the caffeinated art. Through this mutual effort, a quiet yet profound dialogue of respect and connection unfolds.</p>
									<p>During the century-long history of the Bund, the brightness of respect, equality, dignity and honor enlighten the already wondrous street views.</p>
