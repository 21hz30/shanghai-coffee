											<p>Beneath the plane trees of No. 457 Shaanxi North Road, tucked away in quiet shade, stands a garden villa that gracefully blends British grandeur with Eastern elegance—the He Dong Residence.</p>
											<p>Completed in 1928, this historic mansion was once the Shanghai residence of Sir Robert Hotung, then Hong Kong’s wealthiest man. Designed in the style of the English Renaissance, the building stands out as a unique architectural gem in Shanghai. The main house features a pseudo-three-story structure constructed from brick, wood, and stone. Most striking is the Ionic colonnade on the south façade, extending across two floors. Slender columns with delicately carved volutes support the structure, perfectly complemented by wrought-iron balustrades on the curved second-floor balcony. The roughcast stucco walls and bold cornices under wide eaves echo the solemn beauty of 17th-century European architecture.</p>
											<p>In the garden, century-old camphor trees and gnarled vines infuse a touch of Chinese landscape charm, softening the residence’s Western formality. The house once bore witness to the glories of old Shanghai: the Hotung family hosted eminent business figures here, and across the street stood another of their holdings—Peace Garden.</p>
											<p>After 1958, the mansion found a new cultural identity as the editorial home of the Cihai Dictionary, one of modern China’s most authoritative encyclopedic works. Literary giants like Qian Zhongshu once worked at these very desks. Today, the building serves as the office of the Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House, still adorned with original parquet floors and carved wooden entryways. The tranquil courtyard and scholarly atmosphere breathe quiet dignity into this storied place, imbuing it with enduring cultural allure.</p>

            <span id="z5">
											<p>Inside the former Hotung residence now resides Spot Table, the second branch of Coffee Spot. Known for introducing the “coffee set” concept to Shanghai’s café scene, Spot Table curates themed coffee experiences—each set crafted around a central idea and thoughtfully paired with desserts and small bites, creating a holistic sensory experience.</p>
											<p>Set against the backdrop of this Renaissance Revival-style mansion designed by László Hudec, the café is surrounded by expansive green space and ancient trees. Floor-to-ceiling windows open the space to lush garden views, while the natural wood interior creates a warm, artistic atmosphere steeped in serenity.</p>
											<p>Coffee Spot is among the earliest cafés to introduce the “all-in-one set” model into everyday consumption, inspired by the format of World Barista Championships. Their “one bean, three brews” philosophy—offering small pours of black coffee, milk coffee, and a signature drink from the same bean—transforms competition techniques into a menu experience, allowing customers to fully explore the flavor spectrum in a single tasting.</p>
