									<p>The Statue of Peace was once erected where British and French concessions intersect in wartime Shanghai and where Bund and East Yanan Road conjoin at the present. Being set in 1924, The Statue of Peace commemorated the Shanghai expatriates that died during WWI.</p>
									<p>The monument has a main rectangular structure supported by a concrete base reinforced by steel and a hollow interior. The exterior was covered with granite, and the names of the commemorated were engraved on its surface. On top of the monument stood a bronze figure of the Goddess of Peace, modeled after sculptures from ancient Rome.</p>
									<p>A prominent feature of the statue was her outstretched wings, and powerful arms embracing a child into her protection, symbolizing peace and guardianship.</p>
									<p>However, after Japanese troops invaded Shanghai in 1941, the statue, seen as a symbol of British and French production, was violently destroyed due to Japan’s hostile relations with the Allies. Due to the high cost, the British gave up on restoring the statue after war, and the memorial never came back to us.</p>
									<p>Today, the original site remains an open plaza decorated with shrubs, now part of the Bund’s public space. No other new structure has been set up there, leaving it purely as a public landscape.</p>
									<p>However, in Shanghai Film Park, located in Songjiang District, a replica of the Statue of Peace has been erected. As a filming location for many movies and shows regarding WWI Shanghai, the park recreates street views in early 20th century Shanghai, offering a glimpse of the statue as it once stood.</p>

									<p>The Bund, taking the stunning riverside views, filled with old international architecture, and the iconic trio skyscrapers in Pudong, attracts numerous visitors from around the world. Even local citizens would gather with family and friends to enjoy an afternoon tea or a sun-drenched brunch at either a classic old establishment or a trendy new spot.</p>
									<p>There are countless cafes and Western restaurants worth going along the Bund, but one especially worth noticing is POP, located on the 7th floor of Bund No. 3, located at the diagonal opposite the original site of the Statue of Peace.</p>
									<p>What makes POP truly special is its terrace with the unsurpassable river view. From sunset to the first glow of city lights, the historic international buildings suddenly light up in a breathtaking spectacle, a moment of awe that only those who have witnessed it can truly appreciate.</p>
									<p>Even ordering the simplest cup of coffee you get the privilege to enjoy a 270-degree view of the skyline.</p>
