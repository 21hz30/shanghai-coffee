									<p>At the bustling crossroads of Huaihai Middle Road and Maoming South Road, one of Shanghai’s most iconic landmarks has stood quietly for nearly a century—Cathay Theatre, widely hailed as the most beautiful cinema in Shanghai.</p>
									<p>Built in 1930 and originally named Cathay Grand Theatre, the building was designed by Hungarian architect C. H. Gonda officially opened on New Year’s Day 1932. On its debut, Shenbao ran an ad that boldly proclaimed:</p>
									<p>“Luxurious and grand, it leads all cinemas in Shanghai; refined and comfortable, it embodies the height of modern science and design.”</p>
									<p>This confidence was no exaggeration. With its unmatched Art Deco façade, the Cathay instantly distinguished itself. The bold contrast between the deep purplish-red Taishan bricks and the crisp white grout, paired with its geometric, zigzag silhouette, gives the building a striking rhythm—especially under the plane trees that line Huaihai Road.</p>
									<p>Step inside and you’ll find red velvet curtains and elegant relief carvings that still echo the 1930s aura of cinematic luxury, frozen in time. Notably, the original seats were imported from the U.S.—the “Western Electric” brand—and each one had its own built-in heating vent, an extravagance that defined cutting-edge comfort in its day.</p>
									<p>In 1935, comedy legend Charlie Chaplin visited Shanghai and made a special stop here. After 1949, the cinema was renamed “Cathay Theatre” (Guotai Dianyingyuan); during political transitions, it briefly bore the name “People’s Cinema,” but locals never stopped calling it “Cathay.” In 1994, it was officially recognized as a Protected Historic Building of Shanghai, and in 2005, it earned the title of National Five-Star Cinema.</p>
									<p>From August 2022 to January 2024, the theatre underwent a major restoration—preserving its historical charm while upgrading its projection systems to meet modern standards.</p>
									<p>Today, Cathay boasts three uniquely styled screening rooms, still upholding the tradition of community screenings and half-price Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Watching a film here feels like listening to the echoes of history—from silent black-and-white reels in 1932 to today’s immersive IMAX soundscapes. Cathay isn’t just a cinema; it’s a living archive of Chinese film history and a vessel of collective memory for generations of Shanghainese. A fusion of architectural legacy and cultural devotion, the theatre continues to write its cinematic saga on Huaihai Road.</p>

									<p>When the plum rain season soaks Shanghai in its muggy, drizzling haze, take a walk under an umbrella along Maoming and Huaihai—streets steeped in the city’s nostalgic charm. Watch a classic old film at Cathay Theatre, then head downstairs to SHALA, the stylish café nestled in the podium.</p>
									<p>At one moment, it’s a torrential downpour; at the next, sunlight dapples through sycamore branches. Order a specialty coffee called “Plum Rain”—inspired by the verse:</p>
									<p>“How much idle sorrow is there? A river of misty willows, city-wide swirling fluff, the yellow plum rain…”</p>
									<p>The drink blends the tangy sweetness of golden plums with bright acidity for a refreshingly clean finish that washes away the stickiness of rainy days.</p>
									<p>Or pair it with a Shanghainese twist on a croissant, stuffed with yellow croaker and crab roe—an unexpected harmony of sour, sweet, bitter, salty, and umami. This, too, is the taste of life in Shanghai: complex, rich, and deeply satisfying.</p>
