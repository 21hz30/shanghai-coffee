										<p>Trinity Church Shanghai — this “Red Chapel” standing in the Bund’s historic district bears witness to the sweeping changes since Shanghai first opened its port. Originally built in 1847 by early British expatriates to meet their religious needs, it was one of the city’s earliest Christian churches. After the original building was damaged, it was rebuilt in 1869 at its present location (219 Jiujiang Road). Designed in the Gothic Revival style popular in Britain, its distinctive exposed red-brick façade soon gained fame, becoming a landmark example of modern Chinese red-brick architecture. The 54-meter bell tower added in 1893 once stood as the tallest point in Shanghai, overlooking the bustling banks of the Huangpu River.</p>
										<p>Its fate, however, rose and fell with the tides of history. The 20th century brought war and turmoil; during the Cultural Revolution in 1966, the church’s exquisite stained-glass windows were smashed, the bell tower’s spire was forcibly removed, and its interior suffered heavy damage—stripping it of its former glory. Thankfully, its value was never forgotten. Designated a Shanghai Cultural Heritage Site, it underwent a decade-long restoration in the early 21st century, with significant funding from the Hong Kong Sheng Kung Hui (Anglican Church). Guided by the principle of “restoring the old as it was,” the project culminated in 2019 with the successful reconstruction of the bell tower spire and the meticulous repair of its red-brick façade, stone carvings, and stained glass.</p>
										<p>In 2023, this long-slumbering architectural gem awoke to new life. Today, it serves not only as a venue for English-language worship services but also—via appointment-based visits—as a public showcase of Gothic design and exceptional acoustics. A cultural landmark where faith, history, and architectural artistry converge, it silently tells the epic story of Shanghai’s journey from its treaty port beginnings to its modern renaissance.</p>

										<p>The Press Café at the Former Shen Bao Building — Standing at the corner of Hankou Road, this café occupies the original site of Shen Bao, one of China’s most influential newspapers. Founded in 1872, Shen Bao chronicled colonial history and etched the memories of the Republic of China era. The building’s exterior façade remains intact, while the interior preserves numerous historical details—including a photo history wall, ornate coffered ceilings, and even menus styled after the original newspaper.</p>
										<p>Another nostalgic draw lies in the building’s pop-culture footprint—it was a filming location for Romance in the Rain (Qing Shen Shen Yu Meng Meng), a landmark Qiong Yao drama at the turn of the 21st century. The series holds a significance in Chinese-language media far beyond its romantic plot—it served as a mirror of a society in cultural transition, a catalyst for female consciousness, and an influence on the aesthetics of the television industry. Today, it remains a beloved pilgrimage site for viewers who grew up with Qiong Yao’s works. Sit down with a coffee and a slice of cake, and when the background music swells with “Qing Shen Shen Yu Meng Meng…”, you’ll feel a wave of nostalgia rush over you.</p>
