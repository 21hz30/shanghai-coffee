										<p>Ohel Rachel Synagogue (西摩会堂旧址), located at No. 500 Shaanxi North Road (near West Nanjing Road), was built in 1920 by the Sephardic Jewish community in Shanghai, mainly English-Iraqi Jews. It is the oldest and most architecturally exquisite surviving Jewish synagogue in Shanghai, and one of the most important Jewish religious and community centers in the Far East before World War II. Today, it serves as the office for the Jing’an District Education Bureau and is listed as a National Key Cultural Relics Protection Unit.</p>
										<p>The building is a prime example of Neoclassical and Romanesque Revival architecture, with a dignified and elegant red brick façade, delicate window decorations, and once featured a distinctive dome on its roof (later damaged and not rebuilt). Inside, it originally housed a magnificent carved ceiling, stained glass windows, and a beautifully crafted bimah (reading platform), showcasing the peak of Shanghai’s architectural design and craftsmanship at the time.</p>
										<p>During World War II, it became a religious and spiritual refuge for the influx of European Jewish refugees, bearing witness to Shanghai’s humanitarian role as the “Eastern Noah’s Ark.” In 2001, it received the UNESCO Asia-Pacific Cultural Heritage Conservation Award.</p>
										<p>While the synagogue now functions as an administrative office, its core structural and external appearance remain strictly preserved. Unfortunately, it is not open to the public for visits or photography. The original religious spaces have been partially modified to suit office needs, but as a world-class Jewish cultural heritage site and a vital physical testimony to human migration and tragedy, it stands not only as an outstanding historic building but also as an important monument to Shanghai’s multicultural and inclusive spirit and global anti-fascist history.</p>

										<p>Along Shaanxi North Road, numerous intriguing small shops beckon passersby. Just a few dozen meters south of Ohel Moishe, on the first floor of Taiping Garden, is WHOOPSO – 叹所, a coffee shop notable for its slide-like seating that invites visitors to explore coffee in a playful way. WHOOPSO defines its philosophy as a “taste laboratory,” constantly experimenting to find balance between ideals and reality through coffee, bread, desserts, and sandwiches. The owner—a former graphic designer—has installed a vintage Heidelberg printing press as a signature piece, reflecting an industrial and retro aesthetic throughout the space.</p>
										<p>The shop’s limited-edition signature coffee highlights the true essence of the bean—light, bright acidity or rich, bold intensity—each worthy of savoring. Baking plays an indispensable role: the aroma of butter fills the air, the warmth fresh from the oven, the crispy crust shedding crumbs—a comforting carbohydrate happiness.</p>
										<p>In the bustle of daily life, finding such a tranquil retreat to sip slowly in a building full of stories might just be the most luxurious everyday experience.</p>
