									<p>In the heart of Xujiahui’s bustling commercial hub, two towering Gothic spires pierce the skyline—marking the majestic presence of St. Ignatius Cathedral, often hailed as “the largest church in the Far East.”</p>
									<p>Construction began in 1906 under the design of British architect W. M. Dowdall, and after four years of meticulous work, the cathedral was formally completed on October 22, 1910. Oriented west to east, the church occupies 2,670 square meters of land, with a total floor area of 6,700 square meters. Its two bell towers rise to 56.6 meters, and for many years, they made the church one of the tallest structures in Shanghai—even predating the iconic HSBC building on the Bund in being dubbed “Shanghai’s No. 1 building.”</p>
									<p>Architecturally, the cathedral is a masterpiece. Built in the shape of a Latin cross, it follows the five-aisle basilica layout, with 64 finely carved Jinshan stone clustered columns supporting its vast interior. The rose window on the front façade spans five meters in diameter, flanked by four solemn statues of the Gospel Evangelists. Inside, the soaring vaulted ceiling, rising to 26.6 meters, evokes awe; while the stained-glass windows, restored in 2017, bathe the space in vibrant, prismatic light. The high altar, imported from Paris in 1919, remains intact, adorned with intricate carvings of Jesus and the Virgin Mary—silent witnesses to over a century of change.</p>
									<p>The church holds deep ties with the Xu family, particularly the famed Ming dynasty scientist and Catholic convert Xu Guangqi, revered as one of the “Three Pillars of Chinese Catholicism.” The land on which the cathedral stands was donated by his descendants.</p>
									<p>During turbulent decades, the cathedral suffered immense damage: its steeples and crosses were torn down, and the sacred space was repurposed as a fruit warehouse. After being returned to the Church in 1979, the cathedral underwent multiple restorations—the most extensive spanning 2012 to 2018, reviving its former splendor.</p>
									<p>Today, as a National Key Cultural Relic Protection Site, St. Ignatius Cathedral not only serves as the seat of the Bishop of the Shanghai Diocese, but also stands as a beloved cultural landmark for locals and tourists alike. On Sundays, the solemn resonance of the pipe organ fills the cathedral: Chinese-language Mass begins at 7:30 a.m., followed by an English Mass at noon, continuing the church’s founding mission of uniting faith across languages and generations.</p>
									<p>In Easter of 2019, a French visitor was stunned to discover a sacred statue donated by his grandfather still resting beside the altar—proof that this cathedral is not just an architectural gem, but a living repository of memory, witnessing Shanghai’s enduring legacy of spiritual and cultural convergence.</p>

									<p>An old cathedral, a new academy, Western coffee, Eastern culture.</p>
									<p>Opened in 2023, this is Yongpu’s flagship store in Shanghai, nestled within the newly renovated Xujiahui Academy—a symbolic return to the cultural roots of the city. Here, Yongpu explores how a “foreign beverage” can express new layers of Chinese tradition.</p>
									<p>The café’s mascot, Shi Duanzheng, a stylized Chinese stone lion, represents both respect for heritage and a playful push toward youth culture. The shop’s ambiance blends Song dynasty aesthetics with a light retro palette inspired by traditional Chinese design, capturing a new generation’s taste for grace and subtlety.</p>
									<p>Yongpu Coffee transforms the library setting into a light social circle of reading and caffeine, seeking to revitalize historical space with living, aromatic energy.</p>
