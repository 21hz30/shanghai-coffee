											<p>Shanghai Great World, once hailed as the “No. 1 Amusement Park in the Far East,” is a legendary landmark of modern Shanghai’s popular entertainment scene. It was founded in 1917 by the prominent Shanghai businessman Huang Chujiu, right by the bustling foot of the Tibet South Road Bridge. From day one, its opening slogan—“Play all day without spending a penny”—caused a citywide sensation.</p>
											<p>Inside its unique Chinese–Western fusion building were the Qian Kun Grand Theatre, a cinema, variety stages, storytelling halls, Chinese and Western restaurants, and small shops—like a kaleidoscope of amusements under one roof. Day and night, the stages came alive with Peking Opera, Yue Opera, magic shows, slapstick comedy, and other “hundred plays” of the Shanghai style. The Hall of Funhouse Mirrors became especially famous, making the Great World a “kingdom of joy” for young and old alike.</p>
											<p>In 1931, after Huang’s death, the property was purchased by the famed Shanghai tycoon Huang Jinrong and briefly renamed Rong’s Great World, continuing to shape the city’s entertainment trends.</p>
											<p>After 1949, Great World went through major changes. In 1954, the government took over and ran it as the Shanghai People’s Amusement Park. In 1966, with the start of the Cultural Revolution, it was forced to close. By 1974, the building had been repurposed as the Shanghai Youth Palace, stripping away much of its entertainment flair.</p>
											<p>It wasn’t until 1987, in the wake of China’s reform and opening up, that the “Great World” name returned, reopening as a comprehensive amusement center. The funhouse mirrors and folk performances brought back waves of nostalgia. But in the face of new entertainment trends, it gradually fell silent after 2003.</p>
											<p>In 2017, on its centennial anniversary, Great World was reborn with a new mission: to showcase and keep alive intangible cultural heritage. The recreated Hall of Mirrors still draws laughter, while the space has been transformed into a stage and interactive venue for traditional opera, folk music, and crafts. From a modern-age carnival for the masses to today’s “living museum” of cultural memory, Great World has weathered a century of ups and downs—remaining a vivid symbol of Shanghai’s entertainment DNA and the imprint of its times.</p>

            <span id="z5">
											<p>From Great World, it’s just a short walk to the intersection of Weihai Road and Huangpi Road, where you’ll find Shiteng Coffee—a café championing creative, cross-genre collaborations that make coffee endlessly playful.</p>
											<p>Its signature Soy Sauce Latte has been a bestseller for years, served from a traditional soy sauce vat. The salty-savory notes blend into the latte’s smoothness, leaving a sweet aftertaste. Another standout is the Coffee Rice, a steaming earthen pot of latte-infused broth with roasted brown rice and seaweed—a uniquely Shanghai-style coffee comfort dish, deeply “coffee” yet unmistakably “Shanghai.”</p>
											<p>If the sunlight is just right, sit at a table by the doorway or the windowsill, sipping your coffee rice. You might suddenly recall the shikumen houses of your childhood, as the vintage flavors rise in the air.</p>
