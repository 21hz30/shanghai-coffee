											<p>Wukang Mansion (formerly Normandy Apartments), majestically standing at No. 1850 Middle Huaihai Road, resembles a mighty ship cutting through the unique triangular intersection formed by Wukang Road, Xingguo Road, Huaihai Road, Tianping Road, and Yuqing Road. As one of Shanghai’s most iconic historic landmarks, it was designed by the Hungarian architect László Hudec and constructed from 1924 to 1929, funded by the International Savings Society. It ranks among Shanghai’s earliest external corridor apartment buildings and is recognized as an Outstanding Historical Building of Shanghai.</p>
											<p>The mansion’s distinctive French Renaissance style, blended with Art Deco elements, features a clean ochre-red façade, a tripartite composition, and continuous arc-shaped external corridors (later partially enclosed for practicality), stunning all who behold it. Taking full advantage of the site’s 30° angled plot, the building forms a solemn sharp bow shape. Vertical classical arches, horizontal transparent long balconies, and floral decorations crowning the roof together sketch a grand yet elegant rhythm of Southern European architecture.</p>
											<p>Upon completion, it became a prestigious residence known as the “International Apartments,” hosting a distinguished mix of European and American politicians, businessmen, film stars, and cultural figures. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, prominent artists such as Zhao Dan and Wang Renmei became notable residents. Having withstood nearly a century of change, Wukang Mansion stands not only as a witness to the golden era of the French Concession but also as a carrier of Shanghai’s modern urban transformation memories.</p>
											<p>In the early 21st century, meticulous restoration revived its original appearance. The ground floor welcomed cultural and artistic uses, transforming the building from a closed residence into a “three-dimensional museum” of urban culture and life. At sunset, when the “ship’s bow” glows with golden light, Wukang Mansion transcends its identity as mere architecture to become a symbol of Shanghai’s cosmopolitan elegance and enduring spirit, telling the world stories of the city’s openness and timeless charm.</p>

										<p>The Cottage Cafe (老麦咖啡馆), Shanghai’s earliest vintage café, began in 2009 on Taojiang Road and relocated in 2018 to the Wukang Road location, becoming a paradise for retro lovers. Complementing the timeworn aura of Wukang Mansion, the café’s façade blends French and industrial styles. Facing a side with limited sunlight, it compensates with nine large windows that not only brighten the interior but also offer a long row of street-view seats for guests who love city scenes.</p>
										<p>Owner “Old Mike” (老Mike) treats the café as an anthropological archive, distilling over fifty years of Shanghai life memory into this space: the vintage postman’s lamp hanging over the door, the worm-eaten teakwood bar, a medicine cabinet rescued from demolition rubble, and warmly patinated old leather chairs. Each antique piece feels like a museum exhibit with its own story, collectively evoking memories of Shanghai’s lane life and blending perfectly with the Oriental lifestyle ambiance infused in this French-style apartment.</p>
										<p>The ceremonial ritual of hand-drip coffee intertwined with nostalgic surroundings makes The Cottage a paradigm of urban spiritual healing. Amid the wave of specialty coffee culture, it remains committed to a slow-paced neighborhood warmth. When dusk paints Wukang Mansion’s ship-bow relief red, sitting here savoring a cup of Old Mike’s coffee is like drinking in a living history of Shanghai life—turning a century-old building from a cold landmark into a breathing, warm container of urban memory.</p>
