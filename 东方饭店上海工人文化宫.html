										<p>Shanghai Workers’ Cultural Palace, located at 120 Middle Tibet Road, is a nine-story building that once bore the name “Eastern Hotel” and witnessed the bustling international scene of Shanghai’s famed “Ten-Mile Foreign Street.” Designed and completed in 1929 by Hungarian architect László Hudec, its Neoclassical façade features vertical lines like the strings of a grand piano, while the glass spire atop lit up the night sky over the racecourse in the 1930s. Inside, exquisite details like the stained-glass dome, bronze revolving doors, and marble staircases silently tell tales of colonial-era luxury.</p>
										<p>A historic turning point came in 1950 when Mayor Chen Yi renamed it the “Home of Workers,” with Mao Zedong’s inscription “School and Paradise for Workers” carved at the entrance hall. The renovated octagonal auditorium became a spiritual sanctuary for the working class. Model worker report meetings and technical innovation exhibitions sparked vibrant exchanges of ideas. The theater regularly staged era-defining plays like “From a Silent Place,” while the rooftop observatory unveiled the cosmos to workers’ children.</p>
										<p>After the 1990s, the “City Palace” evolved into a diverse cultural space: the Jasmine Flower Theater was revived, ping-pong balls flew in the table tennis room, and golden medals in the model worker exhibition shimmered alongside the 1929 stained-glass dome.</p>
										<p>A 2019 renovation reignited the building’s original spirit: Hudec’s signature octagonal window frames glow with a new light, while behind the red velvet curtains echo both dramatic lines and cheers from e-sports youth. From the jazz echoes of a colonial hotel to the resolute shine of worker badges, this crossroads building proves after ninety years that a true palace ultimately belongs to the people.</p>

										<p>Marmalade, a coffee shop shaking up Shanghai’s coffee scene with its boldly innovative “Venom Coffee,” is a sister store to Orange on Fumin Road—hence the fitting name inspired by orange marmalade.</p>
										<p>With a wood-toned design, its storefront is understated yet rich in detail. The intimate layout offers a long bar by the window for solo sippers and cozy four-person corners perfect for private chats.</p>
										<p>Their signature “Venom” blends homemade liquor-infused syrup with the rich warmth of whiskey, finishing with a lively citrus kick.</p>
										<p>As a socially responsible café actively promoting community culture, Marmalade regularly hosts cross-disciplinary collaborations with local artists and runs ongoing coffee tasting salons.</p>
