											<p>Changde Apartments, originally named Eddington Apartments, is located at 195 Changde Road, Shanghai. Built in 1936, Unit 65 on the 6th floor was Eileen Chang’s residence from 1942 to 1947. Designed by an Italian architect, the building features a reinforced concrete structure in the Art Deco style. Its pale pink exterior walls and curved balconies give it a distinctive charm. Despite standing for nearly a century, it still retains its dignity.</p>
											<p>In that era, high-rise apartments were springing up in the heart of the concessions, and Changde Apartments was one of them. The building’s floor plan is shaped like a concave “凹,” with three units per floor, available in two- and three-bedroom layouts. The 8-story building had wooden floors throughout, fireplaces and radiators in the rooms, small dressing rooms and en-suite bathrooms in the bedrooms, kitchens arranged along the west-facing outer corridor, rear balconies, and separate bathrooms for maids on each floor.</p>
											<p>In the summer of 1942, Eileen Chang returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and moved into Unit 65 on the 6th floor with her aunt, formally beginning her life as an “apartment writer.” It was here that she completed Love in a Fallen City, Aloeswood Incense – The First Brazier, Aloeswood Incense – The Second Brazier, The Golden Cangue, and Sealed Off. This was the most brilliant period of her life.</p>
											<p>The first time Hu Lancheng visited Eileen Chang was here. Taking the elevator up to the 6th floor, he was astonished by the elegance of her apartment. Beyond the balcony stretched all of Shanghai, bathed in drifting clouds and sunlight, while trams clanged back and forth below. Eileen Chang wrote about the many struggles and confrontations between men and women living in the city, creating deeply nuanced characters—yet in her own life, she entrusted herself to the wrong person.</p>

											<p>A Coffee Under Eileen Chang’s Apartment — Eileen Books</p>
											<p>Today, the building remains a residential property, but on the ground floor, Qian Cai Bookshop serves as a memorial to Eileen Chang, attracting literature lovers from near and far. This Eileen Chang–themed café and bookstore, facing the street, once inspired Shanghai writer Wang Anno (elder sister of Wang Anyi) to write about her quiet visit there.</p>
											<p>The shop’s English name, Eileen Books, echoes Eileen Chang’s own name. The aroma of coffee, mingled with the scent of books, grows richer here, and the thick air of nostalgia makes it an ideal place for book lovers to remember her.</p>
											<p>What makes it special is its creative pairing of coffee designs with Eileen Chang’s novels. On a quiet afternoon, sitting by the window with a book in hand and sipping a coffee inspired by a story is a uniquely sensory experience. Red Rose Latte, Love in a Fallen City, Half a Lifelong Romance, Eighteen Springs, Love in the Red Land, Reunion, Traces of Love Lost—each cup is a taste of a past moment, a fragment of an old story.</p>
