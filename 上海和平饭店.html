									<p>The Peace Hotel is a landmark of the Bund as well as one of the most iconic architectures in the whole Shanghai. It is located at the intersection of East Nanjing Road and the Bund. Over the years, the Peace Hotel has had many names: the southern building was originally known as the Hui Zhong Hotel, while the northern building used to be the Cathay Hotel. Because it was funded by the prominent Jewish Sassoon family during World War II, it was also known as the Sassoon Building. After the two buildings were merged, they became what we now know now as the Peace Hotel.</p>
									<p>The Peace Hotel was commissioned by businessman Victor Sassoon and built in 1929, featuring mostly Art Deco style. Its representative Art Deco elements include a unique green copper roof, luxurious interiors, and simple vertical lines as the main structural design. The hotel is luxurious, unrivaled as once the tallest building in Shanghai, as well as one of the first buildings in the world to be equipped with an air conditioning system. Many historical figures, such as Charlie Chaplin and George Bernard Shaw, paid visits and left behind photos and memories.</p>
									<p>To the right of the main entrance is a narrow staircase leading up to a small room on the second floor. There sits a display room recording the history of the hotel including photos, tableware, furniture, small sculptures and other precious items.</p>
									<p>In 1992, the Peace Hotel was designated a National Key Cultural Relic Protection Site. Today, it still retains its strong retro charm. Because the building is open to the public, it has become a “must” for tourists from all over China when coming to Shanghai. The Peace Hotel stands as more than a building, but a symbol of Shanghai’s history and culture.</p>

									<p>The ground floor of the Peace Hotel is the Victor's Cafe, a coffee shop with decor aligns perfectly with the style of the entire building. I often wander along the Bund with my parents, sometimes we would go across the bustling East Nanjing Road. Once we decided to stop by the cafe in the Peace Hotel for afternoon tea and took the chance to explore a bit inside.</p>
									<p>Over twenty years ago, my parents held their wedding at the Peace Hotel, which makes this historic building especially meaningful to our family. I hadn't been there for their wedding two decades ago, but we decided that we could still visit the banquet hall together to see the venue and what it looks like now. The room was quiet and spacious, with a slender rectangular formation. The entrance cut in from the middle of the long side, which is quite different from the layout and design of most modern wedding halls. Opposing the entrance was a small area that juts out slightly, which was the very spot where my parents took group photos with friends and relatives back then.</p>
									<p>Our family has kept a printed photo from that day, including my grandparents and cousin. Since digital photography was rare twenty years ago, the images we have are all printed on photographic paper, with a distinct vintage texture. Though the picture quality and lighting is old, you can still clearly make out the interior design and structure, which remain unchanged to this day.</p>
									<p>The Peace Hotel, now nearly a century old, still stands tall and proud. It is one of the few historic buildings in Shanghai that remains open for the public to freely explore. Standing in the same spot where my parents got married decades ago, I felt a thrilling sense of time folding in on itself.</p>
									<p>Victor's Cafe maintains the same elegant atmosphere that has characterized the Peace Hotel for decades. The coffee served here is carefully selected from premium beans, and the brewing methods reflect both traditional techniques and modern innovations. The cafe's interior design features rich mahogany furniture, crystal chandeliers, and vintage photographs that tell the story of Shanghai's golden era.</p>
									<p>The menu at Victor's Cafe offers a delightful blend of international and local flavors. From classic European pastries to traditional Chinese tea ceremonies, every item is prepared with meticulous attention to detail. The afternoon tea service is particularly popular among both locals and tourists, featuring delicate finger sandwiches, freshly baked scones, and an extensive selection of premium teas.</p>
									<p>The cafe's windows provide stunning views of the bustling Nanjing Road and the historic architecture that surrounds the Peace Hotel. During different times of the day, the natural light creates various moods within the space, from the warm golden glow of morning to the romantic ambiance of evening. This ever-changing atmosphere makes each visit to Victor's Cafe a unique experience.</p>
									<p>Many regular customers have formed lasting memories at Victor's Cafe, just as my family has with the Peace Hotel itself. The staff takes pride in recognizing returning guests and remembering their preferences, creating a sense of community and belonging that extends far beyond a simple coffee shop experience.</p>
