									<p>The Si Hang Warehouse, located at Guangfu Rd. No 21, was built in 1931 and rose to national fame during the 1937 defense against Japanese forces by the “800 Heroes.” Originally a reinforced concrete warehouse jointly owned by four major Chinese banks, it became a symbol of wartime resistance spirit when Commander Xie Jinyuan led his troops to hold off the Japanese army here during the Song Hu Battle.</p>
									<p>Today, many of the surrounding buildings near the Si Hang Warehouse remain well preserved and have been renovated into a modern art district. The west wall of the warehouse itself has been fully preserved, still bearing bullet holes and from war time, which serves as powerful reminders of the brutal history. It has become a major site for patriotic education and a must-visit landmark for those seeking to remember history and learn about the spirit of resistance.</p>
									<p>In 2015, the warehouse was transformed into the Sihang Warehouse Battle Memorial, commemorating its legacy in China’s war of resistance against Japan.</p>

									<p>Due to its prime location on the south of Suzhou River—often referred to as the mother river of southern Shanghai—the Sihang Warehouse enjoys a unique and pleasant landscape. The adjacent old buildings have been preserved and transformed into cafés, restaurants, boutique shops, and art galleries. Among them, People’s Cafe stands out for its distinctive style gaining considerable popularity.</p>
									<p>The name “People’s Café” carries a bold and resonant tone—memorable and full of character. Its interior is thoughtfully designed, with red elements woven throughout the space. Neon lights hang from the ceiling, while the overall dim lighting creates an immersive and indulgent atmosphere. The retro decor, daring and quirky cultural-creative items, and displays of colorful vintage stamps all make it an irresistible photo spot for visitors.</p>
									<p>After visiting the Si Hang Warehouse and its museum, it could be a novel experience to sit down here for a cup of coffee—a blend of the weight of history with the rhythm of contemporary life. Coffee, a symbol of the urban sophistication and lifestyle unique to Shanghai, naturally pops up everywhere. At almost every historical site, you’ll find a coffee shop nearby. In such a way, drinking coffee while visiting places might just give me a new lens through which to see and engage with the city’s past.</p>
