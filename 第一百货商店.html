										<p>Standing at the intersection of East Nanjing Road and Middle Zhejiang Road, Shanghai First Department Store is itself a living epic of Nanjing Road’s commercial history. Founded and opened in 1936 by overseas Chinese businessman Cai Chang, it was originally called the “Da Xin Company” and proudly stood alongside the four major foreign department stores as a symbol of Chinese commercial strength.</p>
										<p>This seven-story Art Deco masterpiece was designed by the Chinese architectural firm Kitai Engineering. Its beige brick façade is inset with dark tall windows, topped by a distinctive Chinese-style glazed tile pavilion—ushering in a “modern Chinese style” for commercial architecture. Inside, four of Asia’s first Otis escalators spiral upward through a lofty atrium, while glass display cases showcase Parisian perfumes alongside Suzhou silk, and the rooftop amusement area called the “Sixteen Views on the Roof” attracted fashionable crowds who lingered late into the night.</p>
										<p>Renamed “First Department Store” in 1953, the escalators gave way to symbols of planned economy life—glass display counters featuring permanent-issue bicycles and Butterfly brand sewing machines. Cloth and grain ration tickets changed hands amidst the clicking of abacuses, while the top-floor exhibition hall became a spiritual hall decorated with photos of model workers and red flag awards.</p>
										<p>After a 2017 renovation by RuEn Design Studio, a brilliant “time-space corridor” was created connecting the old and new buildings: on one side, the original 1936 terrazzo escalator, on the other, a mirrored VR shopping screen. This transformation exemplifies how historic buildings can be culturally anchored in urban development, balancing old and new to preserve unique charm. Urban renewal need not mean wholesale demolition and reconstruction but can instead rejuvenate historic architecture while honoring its roots.</p>
