									<p>The Paramount Ballroom, located at Yuyuan Rds No.218, was established in 1933 and is officially known as “Shanghai Paramount.” Entitled the glory of “Foremost Entertainment Palace of the Far East,” the ballroom stands as an iconic symbol of Shanghai’s Golden Age. The name “Paramount” conveys the meaning of “supreme” or “the highest,” while its Chinese name 百乐门 literally means “enter the door, and all joys should be”</p>
									<p>Architecturally, Paramount blends Art Deco with modern styles. The floors are paved with black-and-white marble tiles, and the interior is lavish and grand. Curved designs appear throughout the ballroom, elevators, and handrails—hallmarks of early 20th-century popular architectural trends.</p>
									<p>Inside, the ballroom houses several dance halls equipped with spring-loaded dance floors and top-tier jazz bands, hosting a variety of music and dance events. In the 1940s, celebrities such as Zhang Xueliang and Xu Zhimo were frequent patrons. The ballroom was closed during the Cultural Revolution but underwent several renovations and reopened in 2017, continuing to celebrate the song-and-dance culture of old Shanghai.</p>
									<p>Situated in today’s bustling Jing’an Temple commercial district, although it no longer draws crowds like it once did, Paramount remains one of Shanghai’s most renowned and historic landmarks.</p>

									<p>Just a hundred meters south of Paramount Ballroom along Huashan Road is a newly opened café called Shanghai Coffee. With over a hundred cafés near Jing’an Temple, this one stands out as truly unique. Some say it’s not “authentic,” others call it an old-fashioned flavor—but drinking coffee here is really about savoring a nostalgic Shanghai coffee culture.</p>
									<p>The story begins in 1935, when Zhejiang businessman Zhang Bao established the first Chinese-owned coffee shop in Shanghai at 1442 Jing’an Temple Road (now the corner of Nanjing West Road and Tongren Road). Named Desheng Coffee Import Company, it was later reorganized into the Shanghai Coffee Factory. Besides their classic Shanghai-branded coffee, popular products included Lekoufu (a malted milk drink), malt extract, chrysanthemum essence, and more. In times of scarcity, these beverages were considered luxurious treats—a sweet memory for many childhoods.</p>
									<p>Though the new Shanghai Coffee café is not located at the original site, it sits amid a neighborhood shaded by plane trees and surrounded by historic landmarks like Cai Yuanpei’s former residence and the Shanghai Grand Theatre. It’s the perfect cozy spot for a restful pause or a casual chat.</p>
