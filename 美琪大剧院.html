									<p>The Majestic Theatre was built in 1941 and is located at 66 Jiangning Road in present-day Shanghai. The name “Majestic" was chosen to provoke a sense of perfection and elegance, suggesting something magnificent and flawless like fine jade. After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, it was temporarily renamed Beijing Cinema & Theatre.</p>
									<p>Designed by architect Fan Wenzhao, the theatre was constructed using concrete, decorated in the manner of Art Deco style, becoming a typical icon of early 20th-century architecture. At the entrance, curved staircases and neon signage create a striking impression. The theatre holds 1261 seats and was once entitled as “Asian No. 1” in its time.</p>
									<p>The Majestic Theatre gained a solid reputation both domestically and internationally as one of the earliest multi-functioned performance centers in China. It was equipped in order to hold large-scale musicals, dance productions, ballet, and many other performance arts, serving as a key space for cultural exchange between China and the world. Legendary Peking opera artist Mei Lanfang and other renowned performers have performed here. Even today, the theatre continues to host fine performances and stands as one of Shanghai’s most important cultural landmarks.</p>
									<p>The theatre is situated near the “Mei-Heng-Tai” golden triangle: the fashionable Mei Long Town Plaza, one of the first shopping malls in Shanghai to be funded by Japanese capital; CITIC Square, a mix of commercial complex operated by CITIC Group; and Plaza 66, which remains a benchmark for luxury fashion in Puxi.</p>
									<p>In recent years, as Shanghai’s commercial development expands gradually, each administrative district has cultivated its own shopping and cultural hubs. As a result, traffic at the intersection of Jiangning Road and West Nanjing Road was left out bit by bit.</p>
            </span>
            <span id="z5">
									<p>The Majestic Theatre has gradually lost its competitiveness in the market due to a combination of factors: outdated facilities, a lack of timely strategic adjustments, and a rather traditional operating model. However, with the recent reopening of Mei Long Town Plaza nearby, foot traffic and visibility at this intersection may increase, and the Majestic Theatre—with its unique architectural features and rich historical legacy—has the potential to reemerge as a cultural and historical hotspot popular among visitors and social media users.</p>
									<p>A noteworthy highlight is the Manner Coffee shop located at the side entrance of the theatre’s podium. Located within the historical structure of the theatre, this cafe offers a distinctive charm. It serves as a fusion of heritage architecture and artisanal coffee culture. Small but refined, quiet and calming. Pushing through the antique wooden doors into the long, dimly lit space, it is easy to immerse in an atmosphere steeped in history. Even a quick takeaway coffee is infused with the lingering charm of the past. This unique ambiance has made it a trending check-in spot for both locals and tourists.</p>
									<p>But this cafe is more than just a place for coffee—it serves as a cultural bridge between audiences and the theatre, redefining the use of a historic building, and enhances the brand value of the Majestic Theatre. It is a prime example of how commercial value revives and boosts the spirit of a place.</p>
