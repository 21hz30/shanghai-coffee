									<p>Shanghai Mansion: A Shining Jewel of the Bund</p>
									<p>Shanghai Mansion, formerly known as Broadway Mansions, is a dazzling architectural gem among the historic skyline of the Bund. Since its completion in 1934, this 22-story modernist tower, designed by British architect Bright Fraser, has drawn global attention with its distinctive charm. Rising 76.7 meters, the building stands at 20 North Suzhou Road, right where Suzhou Creek meets the Huangpu River, and was once the tallest hotel in Shanghai. To this day, it preserves countless precious traces of its storied past.</p>
									<p>Wandering through its interiors feels like stepping into a time capsule. Vintage elevators from the 1930s, intricate bronze detailing, and the nostalgic atmosphere transport visitors to another era. The 18th-floor observatory, once known as the “No. 1 Viewing Platform in the Far East,” offered panoramic views of the Bund and Huangpu River—a treasured memory for generations of Shanghainese.</p>
									<p>Originally built on the site of the British-owned Shanghai Electric Construction Company, the name “Broadway Mansions” was derived from Broadway Road (now Daming Road), not New York’s Broadway as commonly assumed. On May 1, 1951, the building was renamed Shanghai Mansion, becoming a prestigious venue for receiving foreign guests. Over the decades, it has hosted numerous international dignitaries, including British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher.</p>
									<p>Today, as a five-star heritage hotel, Shanghai Mansion continues to exude elegance. Among its 248 guest rooms, the most sought-after are the luxury river-view suites, where guests can lie in bed and admire the iconic Waibaidu Bridge and Lujiazui skyline. Its still-operating 1930s elevators have become a beloved photo spot for tourists and locals alike. Just steps away from the Waibaidu Bridge, the mansion forms one of the most iconic vistas of the Bund. Each morning, photography enthusiasts gather to capture the first rays of sunlight hitting the building’s historic façade.</p>
									<p>From its origins as a symbol of British commercial presence to its current role as a cultural landmark, Shanghai Mansion has witnessed the city’s transformation—from the “Paris of the East” to a global metropolis. Among the 14 officially protected historic buildings along the Bund, it stands out for its architectural character and deep historical resonance—continuing to write its own legendary chapter in the evolving story of Shanghai.</p>

									<p>While the lobby bar and upper-level restaurants inside the Shanghai Mansion offer coffee and afternoon tea, just around the corner on Fude Road, hidden in a quiet alley, is a much more charming find: a 22-year-old hand-brew café run by a Shanghai local couple—ALT Matsuyastyle Pour-Over Coffee.</p>
									<p>One of Shanghai’s earliest Japanese-style single-origin hand-pour cafés, ALT not only pioneered this brewing style in the city but also helped cultivate and popularize a generation of local baristas trained in Japanese pour-over techniques.</p>
									<p>The coffee beans lined up on the counter are hand-selected and regularly brought back from Japan by the owners themselves. The cozy, compact space is thoughtfully arranged with brewing tools and storage vessels, exuding a warm and delicate ambiance.</p>
									<p>Here, the traditional Showa-era brewing method is elevated into a refined aesthetic of coffee precision. The owners’ decades-long dedication to craftsmanship delivers a consistently high-quality pour-over experience. More than just a drink, each cup offers a taste of culture, a moment of mindfulness.</p>
									<p>Take a sip of this warm, handcrafted brew while sitting on a narrow wooden bench. Strike up a light conversation with a stranger or two. Let the afternoon sun slant gently across your shoulders. Could there be a more peaceful way to enjoy the day?</p>
