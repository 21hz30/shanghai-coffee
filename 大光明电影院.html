											<p>Grand Cinema Located at 216 West Nanjing Road, the Grand Cinema is one of the oldest surviving cinemas in China, first built in 1928 and once hailed as the “Number One Cinema in the Far East.” It was founded by Teochew businessman Gao Yongqing, who, together with foreign investors, converted the Carlton Dance Hall on Jing’an Temple Road into a cinema named “Grand Cinema.” At the time, it featured a tea room, wine bar, smoking lounge, and waiting area. On December 23, 1928, Peking Opera master Mei Lanfang personally cut the ribbon for its grand opening.</p>
											<p>In 1930, the cinema screened the American film Not Afraid to Die, which contained anti-Chinese content. Public outrage and boycotts forced it to close. In 1933, Hungarian architect László Hudec was commissioned to completely redesign the cinema. With its luxurious facilities, the rebuilt Grand Cinema regained its title as the most prestigious theater in the Far East. In 1989, it was listed as a Shanghai Cultural Heritage Site.</p>
											<p>In 2008, the building underwent a 120-million-yuan restoration to return it to its 1933 glory. While its original 1,900-seat hall was reduced by over 600 seats, the two-tier auditorium layout remained.</p>
											<p>Before the liberation of Shanghai, Hollywood studios dominated the city’s film market, and the Grand mainly screened productions from America’s “Big Eight” studios. The first domestic film it ever screened was The Legend of the Red Sheep Hero by Xinhua Film Company. The Grand was also China’s first widescreen cinema and the first stereo sound cinema, and it held the top spot in Shanghai’s box office rankings for 11 consecutive years — witnessing the rise and fall of Chinese cinema.</p>

											<p>During the Shanghai International Film Festival, coffee added another layer of delight. The Grand teamed up with the third-floor Midnight Café to launch a Film Festival Signature Stamped Coffee — just show two movie tickets to get a cup for only 9.9 yuan.</p>
											<p>On one side, the century-old Grand Cinema carries the cinematic memories of generations. On the other, the Midnight Café serves up atmosphere and flavor, blending film culture with coffee in a dreamy collaboration. The coffee comes topped with a custom logo in delicate milk foam, and the special recipe incorporates both the festival’s spirit and the Grand’s own heritage. One sip, and the taste is steeped in cinematic culture.</p>
											<p>Find a window seat overlooking the bustling Nanjing Road, and let the moment linger. This pop-up coffee is only available during the festival, so keep an eye on Grand Cinema’s posters — you won’t want to miss next year’s special brew.</p>
