										<p>Park Hotel, located at the corner of West Nanjing Road and Huanghe Road, was completed in 1934. It was one of Shanghai’s most famous hotels from the 1930s to 1940s, serving as a city landmark and the origin point of Shanghai’s urban coordinate system. Since its completion, the building’s interior décor has undergone multiple renovations, and ownership has changed hands. On May 25, 2006, the Park Hotel was designated a National Key Cultural Relic Protection Unit.</p>
										<p>In May 1930, the Joint Savings Society—formed by the Continental Bank, Salt Industry Bank, China & South Sea Bank, and Kincheng Bank—purchased a plot of land opposite the Shanghai Racecourse for 450,000 taels of silver. Their ambition was to construct the tallest building in Asia, a symbol of their financial strength. Hungarian architect László Hudec led the design, with his brother György Hudec also contributing. Initially planned as an apartment building, Hudec suggested converting it into a luxury hotel. Wu Shoulian, then regional sales manager of the American Motors Company for the Far East, also argued that a luxury hotel would be more profitable. The Society agreed, and the plan was changed.</p>
										<p>Construction was undertaken by the Danish firm Carl Konigsfeld & Co., with Qiaxing Construction responsible for the two basement levels and Fook Kee Construction winning the bid for the above-ground structure. The building was completed in June 1934 and opened to the public, known also as the Joint Savings Society Building. Upon completion, it surpassed the Sassoon House to become the tallest building in Shanghai, China, and indeed all of Asia—earning the title “The Tallest Building in the Far East.”</p>

										<p>Park Hotel Lobby Lounge – One cup of coffee, a century of Shanghai.</p>
										<p>Here, the glamour of 1930s Shanghai began. In an Art Deco setting, you can feel the city’s hundred years of triumphs and transformations. Enjoy the old-school elegance of a top-tier hotel in the “Laokele” tradition, sit at the very origin point of Shanghai’s coordinate system, sip on history, and taste the hotel’s legendary butterfly pastries—consuming not just coffee, but history and nostalgia.</p>
										<p>The coffee itself may not rival that of a cutting-edge specialty café, but the irreplaceable historical atmosphere, cultural symbolism, sense of identity, and ritual make for an immersive experience—blending the flavor of coffee with the taste of living history.</p>										</div>
